# {Binaries-Selection}
This code selects wide binary stars from the El Badry+ catalog ([2018MNRAS.480.4884E](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.4884E/abstract)) and performs a cross-match with the third data release of Gaia ([2023A&A...674A...1G](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...674A...1G/abstract)). Additionally, it plots the binary systems alongside MIST evolutionary tracks ([2016ApJ...823..102C](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...823..102C/abstract)).
